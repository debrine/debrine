## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dylan Brine. I am a full stack developer with experience in the React/Typescript/AWS stack. I am set to graduate from Memorial University of Newfoundland and Labrador in May 2022, and am currently seeking full-time employment to begin after graduation. 

### What am I currently working on?
Right now I am working on my workout-buddy web application. The app is used to track and analyze workout progress for resistance weight training. The application will be utilizing React in the front-end, Node.js in the backend, while being powered by AWS.
